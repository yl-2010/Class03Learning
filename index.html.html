        <h1>My Favorite Thing About School</h1>
        <h2 style="color:slateblue"><em>By Yan Levin, Period F Web Design</em> finished at <time>10:57</time> on Wednesday the 11th</h2>
        <h3 style="color:darkgray">Project Notes:</h3>
        <p style="color:darkgray">I don't have any prior experience with html or web design in general. However, I still wanted to challenge myself by including some of the challenge add-ons: an embedded YT Video and metadata.</p> 
        <p style="color:darkgray">Also, the HTML tag that I didn't already know was the time tag, used above.</p>
        <p><strong>Here are my three favorite things about <a href="https://www.eastsideprep.org">this school</a> (compared to my <a href="https://ems.lwsd.org">old school</a>):</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Smaller Class Sizes</li>
            <li>Longer Class Times</li>
            <li>Study Halls</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Smaller Class Sizes:</h3>
        <p>
            The biggest improvement I noticed between EPS and EMS (my old school) was the size of classes. 
            At EMS, classes had between 25 and 30 people on average, with no cap on the number. 
            However, EPS classes are normally closer to 15 people, with a cap at 18.
        </p>
        <h1><img src="images/party.png" alt="emoji" width="25" height="25">18>30<img src="images/angry.png" alt="emoji" width="25" height="25"></h1>
        <img src="images/thumbsupsmiling.png" alt="emoji" width="250" height="250">
        <p>18 is <em>definitely</em> greater than 30.</p>
        <h3>Longer Periods:</h3>
        <p>
            Another improvement from EMS to EPS is that the classes are longer, 
            allowing me to learn things more in depth each class, 
            instead of switching classes every 45 minutes. 
            Here are the two daily schedules compared:

        <h4>Eastside Preparatory School:</h4>
        <img src="images/eps.JPEG" alt="schedule" width="516" height="667.2">
        <h3>Study Halls:</h3>
        <p>
            The final thing that I like about EPS are the study hall / free periods. 
            They let me get my homework done in school, so I'm free at home. 
            In Middle School, I had to spend a lot of time at home doing homeowork, so this is a big improvement.
